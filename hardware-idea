parts
-pcb with keyboard buttons connected to pico
-joystick as mouse, maybe connact to zero's gpio?
-pico to emulate a usb keyboard (https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-pico-mechanical-keyboard-with-fritzing-circuitpython/overview)
-pico mounted with headers (easier to solder than a rp2040)
-pico connected to RPI zero through bottom usb pin plates (on both pico and zero)
-2x SD card readers on PCB or on separate breakout boards (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4682) - might be able to mount straight onto pcb and direct connect to rpi' zero's gpio
-display to use HDMI on zero and be powered by zero. if such a device exists 
   - this? https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-a.htm
-battery adapter???
-lots of spring contact pins for connections
